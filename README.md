# Beacon
Beacon is an offline Raspberry Pi project to serve Wiki sites, maps, and other important data in scenarios that internet is not available. The RPi will be configured with a Wifi hotspot that clients can connect to and access data using FQDNs through a web browser rather than any special apps.
